# Transfer Algorithm Analysis

## Results Summary
- **Previous**: 3/11 successful (27%)
- **Current**: 4/11 successful (36%)
- **Improvement**: +1 track (+9%)

## Analysis

### Modest Improvement
Going from 3 to 4 successful transfers indicates that our algorithm improvements helped, but only marginally. This suggests:

1. **One track benefited from the changes** - Likely one of these:
   - "Filmic - Original Mix" (had only 1 exact match)
   - A track where the primary artist matching logic helped
   - A track where the lowered threshold (130 vs 170) made the difference

2. **Remaining 7 tracks still have issues**:
   - Multiple matches that are too similar to auto-select
   - The scoring system still isn't differentiating well enough
   - May need more aggressive matching strategies

### Why the Limited Improvement?

1. **Conservative Threshold**: Even at 130, we might still be too conservative
2. **Multiple Matches Problem**: Many tracks have legitimate multiple versions (remixes, radio edits, etc.)
3. **Missing Data**: We're not using ISRC codes which could provide exact matches

### Next Steps to Consider

1. **Add ISRC Matching**: 
   - Spotify provides ISRC codes
   - If Apple Music returns ISRC in their API, this would be definitive

2. **User Preferences**:
   - Add option to prefer: Original/Radio Edit/Extended Mix
   - Add option for "best guess" mode (auto-select top match even if uncertain)

3. **Track-Specific Rules**:
   - For "featuring" tracks, prioritize by primary artist
   - For remix tracks, match the remixer name exactly

4. **Lower Threshold Further**:
   - Try threshold of 100 for auto-selection
   - Or implement a "confidence percentage" where 80%+ confidence auto-selects

5. **Album Matching Weight**:
   - Increase the importance of album name matches
   - Exact album match should almost guarantee selection

### Specific Improvements Needed

Looking at the failed tracks from the original analysis:
- **Kaskade - Angel On My Shoulder**: Multiple versions, needs exact album match priority
- **Summit (feat. Ellie Goulding)**: Has exact match in results, threshold too high
- **Pressure (Alesso Remix)**: Multiple DJ mixes, need to filter those out
- **Binary Finary - 1998**: Duration mismatch (210s vs 588s) suggests different versions

The algorithm needs to be more decisive when there's a clear "best" match, even if it's not perfect.
