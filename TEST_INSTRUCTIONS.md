# Testing the Improved Transfer Algorithm

## What's Been Improved

1. **Better Scoring System**:
   - More nuanced name matching (partial matches get partial scores)
   - Improved artist matching logic (handles primary artist vs featured artists)
   - Dynamic duration tolerance (longer tracks get more leeway)
   - Better handling of remixes vs originals

2. **Dynamic Threshold**:
   - Base threshold lowered from 170 to 130
   - Single matches with score â‰¥100 auto-select
   - Clear winners (1.5x better than second place) auto-select
   - Exact name + artist matches always auto-select

3. **Expected Improvements**:
   - "Filmic - Original Mix" by Above & Beyond (only 1 match, should auto-select)
   - Tracks with exact matches in Apple Music should now transfer
   - Better handling of remix identification

## How to Test

1. Make sure the app is running on http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with Spotify if not already authenticated
3. Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/test-transfer-improved
4. The results will be:
   - Displayed in your browser
   - Saved to `transfer-result-improved.json`
   - Compared with the previous run

## Or Use the Test Page

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/test-transfer
2. Click "Start Test Transfer"
3. Results will be displayed on the page

## Manual Verification

After running, check `transfer-result-improved.json` and compare with `test-transfer.json` to see:
- How many more tracks transferred successfully
- Which specific tracks are now working
- Any remaining issues to address
