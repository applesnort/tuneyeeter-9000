# Transfer Algorithm Improvements V2

## Changes Made (More Aggressive)

### 1. Lower Base Threshold
- Reduced from 130 to 100
- Single matches with score ≥80 now auto-select
- This should help tracks like "Filmic" with only one good match

### 2. More Lenient "Clear Winner" Logic  
- Now accepts top match if it's just 30% better than second (was 50%)
- Threshold for clear winner lowered to 90 (was 120)

### 3. Special Case Handling
- **Exact name + artist**: Always auto-selects
- **Exact name + album**: Auto-selects if score ≥80
- **High score + good duration**: Auto-selects if score ≥100 and duration within 5s

### 4. DJ Mix Filtering
- Non-DJ mix tracks now filter out DJ mix album results
- Prevents tracks from being matched to compilation/mix albums
- Should help with "Pressure (Alesso Remix)" type matches

### 5. Better Logging
- Added console logs for auto-selection decisions
- Makes it easier to debug why tracks are/aren't matching

## Expected Results

These changes should significantly improve the match rate:

1. **"Filmic - Original Mix"** - Single exact match should now auto-select
2. **"Summit"** - Exact match exists, should now select with lower threshold  
3. **"Pressure (Alesso Remix)"** - DJ mix versions filtered out
4. **"Angel On My Shoulder"** - Better exact match detection
5. **"Days to Come"** - Should match with exact name/artist
6. **"1998 (Paul van Dyk Remix)"** - May still struggle due to duration difference
7. **"Right Back"** - Two identical extended mixes, should pick one

## Predicted Outcome

With these more aggressive changes, we should see:
- **Previous**: 3/11 successful
- **First attempt**: 4/11 successful  
- **Expected now**: 7-9/11 successful

The remaining failures would likely be:
- Tracks with genuinely ambiguous matches (multiple valid versions)
- Tracks with significant metadata differences between Spotify and Apple Music
